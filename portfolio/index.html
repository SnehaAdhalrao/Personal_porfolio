                Sneha Adhalrao here, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering degree at the Pimpri Chinchwad College
                of Engineering and Research. I excelled in my secondary education, achieving a top rank and a score of
                95% at SDPVL Landewadi. This academic momentum continued in my higher secondary education at Mahatma
                Gandhi Junior College, Manchar, where I again secured a top rank with a commendable 93%.
                My skillset extends beyond academics. I possess proficiency in Markup languages like HTML, CSS, and also
                JavaScript, along with the ability to manage databases using MySQL. Always seeking to expand my
                knowledge, I'm currently delving into the exciting world of app development.
                Beyond academics, I enjoy staying active through sports like badminton and cricket. Additionally, I have
                a passion for creative expression through dance, singing, and sketching.
                My strong work ethic and dedication to continuous learning make me a valuable asset to any team
                environment. I am eager to leverage my academic achievements and technical skills to contribute to
                innovative projects and make a positive impact.
                my creativity and problem-solving abilities, which I believe will be instrumental in tackling complex
                challenges in industrial field.

                            <p>Our first-year PBL project tackled a fascinating challenge: developing algorithms (in
                                Java) to calculate the domination number for various graph types. The domination number
                                signifies the minimum number of vertices needed to "dominate" all other vertices in a
                                graph. We delved into the algorithmic aspects, crafting efficient solutions for diverse
                                graph structures. This project not only honed our Java programming skills but also
                                fostered critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. The project's success,
                                culminating in a prestigious award, solidified our passion for computer science and
                                collaborative learning.</p>

                            <p>As a member of the RoboHawks club at PCCoER, I'm actively involved in developing robotic
                                modules to enhance our Internet of Things (IoT) knowledge. One such project involved
                                creating a pick-and-drop robot module. This project not only deepened our understanding
                                of IoT principles but also equipped us with the skills to guide participants in
                                ROBORASHTRA, a prestigious national robotics competition organized by DIAT. Our
                                involvement in RoboHawks allows us to contribute to the club's success while fostering
                                our own passion for robotics and mentorship.</p>
